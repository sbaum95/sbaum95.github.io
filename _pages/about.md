I am a PhD student in Population Health Sciences (Department of Global Health and Population) at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. 

My research is at the intersection of infectious disease epidemiology and economics, with a focus on the role of human behavior in disease prevention, detection, and transmission. I am interested in mathematical modelling, disease surveillance, antibiotic resistance, and the design and evaluation of interventions to predict, prevent, and respond to disease outbreaks. I am advised by Dr. Nick Menzies and am affiliated with the Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics. 

Prior to starting my PhD, I worked at MITâ€™s Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab (J-PAL), EcoHealth Alliance, Population Services International, and the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. I received my BA in Economics from Barnard College, Columbia University.
