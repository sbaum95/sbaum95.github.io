I am a PhD student in the Department of Global Health and Population at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. 

My research is at the intersection of health economics and infectious diseases, with a focus on the role of human behavior in disease prevention, detection, and transmission. I combine health economics, causal inference methods, and mathematical modeling to study how individual and provider decision-making, 
particularly around demand for and supply of diagnostic testing, impact disease surveillance data.

Prior to starting my PhD, I worked at MITâ€™s Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab (J-PAL), EcoHealth Alliance, Population Services International, and the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. I received my BA in Economics from Barnard College, Columbia University in 2017.
