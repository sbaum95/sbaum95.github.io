I am a PhD candidate in Population Health Sciences (Department of Global Health and Population) at Harvard University. 

I study the drivers of patient and provider demand for diagnostic information, interventions aimed at improving the allocation of testing, and approaches to correct potential biases from these sources of selection in surveillance data. My research combines applied microeconomics, infectious disease modeling, and quasi-experimental causal inference methods. 

I am affiliated with the Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics and the Institute for Quantitative Social Science. 

Prior to starting my PhD, I worked at MIT’s Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab (J-PAL), Population Services International, EcoHealth Alliance, and the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. I received my BA in Economics from Barnard College, Columbia University.
